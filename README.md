# Collatz-Traces
A dashboard with some interesting visualization of Collatz Traces.
Created using [Dash](https://plot.ly/products/dash/) as part of the Dash Challenge.

The project explores the traces of numbers following the Collatz algorithm down to 1.
It is intended to inform users of the Collatz conjecture and get them interested in it.
